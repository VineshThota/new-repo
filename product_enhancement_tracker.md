# Product Enhancement Tracker Database

## Purpose
This file tracks all products that have been analyzed to prevent duplicates and maintain a record of AI enhancement projects.

## Database Schema

| | | | | | | |

## Status Definitions
- **Research**: Currently being researched
- **In Progress**: Solution being developed
